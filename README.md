## Problem 

Sudoku is a popular single player game. The objective is to fill a 9x9 matrix with digits so that each column, each row, and all 9 non-overlapping 3x3 sub-matrices contain all the digits from 1 through 9. Each 9x9 matrix is partially completed at the start of game play and typically has a unique solution.

Given a completed N2xN2 Sudoku matrix, your task is to determine whether it is a valid solution. A valid solution must satisfy the following criteria:

* Each row contains each number from 1 to N2, once each.
* Each column contains each number from 1 to N2, once each.
* Divide the N2xN2 matrix into N2 non-overlapping NxN sub-matrices. Each sub-matrix contains each number from 1 to N2, once each.

You don't need to worry about the uniqueness of the problem. Just check if the given matrix is a valid solution.
