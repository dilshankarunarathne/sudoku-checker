## Problem 

Sudoku is a popular single player game. The objective is to fill a 9x9 matrix with digits so that each column, each row, and all 9 non-overlapping 3x3 sub-matrices contain all the digits from 1 through 9. Each 9x9 matrix is partially completed at the start of game play and typically has a unique solution.
